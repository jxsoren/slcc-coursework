## Instructions:

Create a new Java file called `Dice.java`

- Simulate the rolling of 2 dice.
  Do that by creating one single object of type Random and by reusing it to roll 
  the first die and then the second die.
- Once both dice have been rolled calculate the sum of the two values.
- Use a one-dimensional integer array to count how often each sum appears.
  When rolling two dice the sum will be a value from 2 â€“ 12. However, not every 
  sum has the same probability of being rolled.
  E.g.: There are three ways to roll a sum of 4, six ways to roll a sum of 7 but only 
  one way to roll a sum of 12.
- Roll the two dice 36,000 times.
- Display the results in a tabular format like in the sample output. Start with a 
  header line (Sum, Frequency, and Percentage) and list the numbers in right 
  aligned columns.
  The percentage should display only one digit after the decimal point.
  In order to output % within a format string write %%

Tip: Check whether the results are reasonable (e.g. the sum 7 should be rolled 
about 1/6 of the time)

## Video Recording Instructions:
Create a **video recording** that is **40 - 80 seconds** long. It should include the following:
* A **title page** that lists the name of the assignment and the names of all who contributed to the code.
* **Your code.** Calmly scroll from top to bottom. Maximize the height of the editor window to minimize scrolling and avoid scrolling back up.
* The **running program** After you have shown the code, run the program. Adjust the size of the output window to provide enough room for the output.

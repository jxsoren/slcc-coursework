- Create a new **jGrasp project** called **A01** that includes one java file called **A01.java**.
- **Include a block comment** of the following form on top of the file:

```java
/*****************************************
- Assignment: Axx – assignment name
*  
- Author: Your Name + tutor names (if applicable)
******************************************/
```

- **Print the snowman and the cat** as shown in the expected output below.  
     Pay close attention to detail. Make sure that your output matches exactly the output specified.  
     FYI: The first character is the underscore of the hat (no leading spaces).  
      There are 5 spaces between the rim of the hat and the ear of the cat.  
      There are also 5 spaces between the head of the cheek of the snowman and the cheek of the cat  
     Notice that a double-quote was used to print the snowman’s eyes and that the cat’s ears were printed  
     using slashes and back-slashes.
- **Create a screen recording** in one of the following formats: mp4 or Kaltura  
     If you have already a software that you like to use for screen casts that’s great.  
     If you don’t check out https://screencast-o-matic.com/screen_recorder. It is free and easy to use.  
     The recording should be max 1 minute long.  
     Briefly introduce yourself (e.g. “Hi, I am Tim. This is my assignment 01 . . . “)  
     Then start by compiling and running the finished code.  
     Make sure the output window is large enough so that the whole output can be seen  
     Then resize the window so that the whole source code is shown (including the comment on top)  
     There is no need to show the output or the source code very long. I’ll pause the video as needed.

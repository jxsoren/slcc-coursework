# Midterm2 Prep - Code CSIS-1400

## Exercise Selection

Read in an animal from the user.
Use a switch statement to produce the following output:
- If the animal is a dog, a cat, or a horse, print "That's a mammal"
- If the animal is a fish or whale print "Lives in the water"
- If the animal is a bird, a bat, or an insect print "It can fly"
- Otherwise print "Your choice: whatTheUserEntered"

### Sample Output of 4 test runs:

```
Please enter an animal: dog
That's a mammal

Please enter an animal: fish
Lives in the water

Please enter an animal: bird
It can fly

Please enter an animal: yak
Your choice: yak
```

## Exercise Loop

Use a loop to produce the output described below.

Notice:
- The numbers in the center are the squares from the numbers on the left
- The one-s and ten-s line up 
- For each of the squares the program determines whether the number is even or not

### Output:

```
#1:  1 is not even
#2:  4 is even
#3:  9 is not even
#4: 16 is even
#5: 25 is not even
#6: 36 is even
#7: 49 is not even
#8: 64 is even
#9: 81 is not even
```

## Exercise Random

- Generate 49 random numbers.
- Pass the value 17 to the constructor of class Random 
  (This way your output should look like the one shown below)
- All random numbers need to be multiples of 50 from 100 to 750 inclusive
- Print the numbers in 7 rows of 7 columns each

### Output:

```
300 400 300 500 100 650 100 
550 100 500 450 250 300 550 
600 700 250 650 350 450 450 
150 250 600 500 150 200 550 
400 400 200 450 250 150 700 
300 100 100 550 250 350 750 
450 550 500 650 150 500 700 
```

The Horse table has the following columns:

    ID - integer, primary key
    RegisteredName - variable-length string
    Breed - variable-length string
    Height - decimal number
    BirthDate - date

Write a statement that selects the registered name and height for only horses that have an above average height. Order the results by height (ascending).

Hint: Use a subquery to find the average height.

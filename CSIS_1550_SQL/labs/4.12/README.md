The Employee table has the following columns:

    ID - integer, primary key
    FirstName - variable-length string
    LastName - variable-length string
    ManagerID - integer

Write a statement that selects employees' first name and their managers' first name. Select only employees that have a manager. Order the result by employee first name. Use aliases to name the result columns Employee and Manager.

Hint: Join Employee to itself using INNER JOIN.
